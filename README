Fedorakmod - Yum Plugin for Kernel Modules
==========================================

Plugin for Yum to handle kernel modules as described by the Fedora Extras
packaging standards.  (Now obsolete as Fedora no longer includes kernel
module packages.)

    http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Obsolete/KernelModules

We can install a kmod for all installed kernel versions/variants.  Set

    installforallkernels = 1

in the conf file.  The default is to turn this feature on.  Set to 0
to disable.

We can delay instalation of a new kernel until the needed kmods are 
available based on the kmods installed for the running kernel.  Set

    pinkernels = 1

in the conf file.  Any other value or a missing pinkernels line defaults
to turn this functionality off.

To Do
=====
Hopefully nothing.
